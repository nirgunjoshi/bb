        Boredom Busters: Keeping occupied during quarantine!
    </h1>

    <h2 style="font-family: cursive;">
        Keeping your children or your siblings occupied during quarantine can be tough! Here are some of my favorite activities for staying sane:
    </h2>

    <h3 style="color: blue;">
        #1 Camp Khan Kids/ Camp Khan
    </h3>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">
        This is one of my favorite activities to do! These summer activities are absolutely free and are even categorized by age. For ages 2-8, there is camp khan kids, and for ages 9 and above, there is camp khan. All you need to do to participate is download
        the Khan Academy Kids or the Khan Academy app and create an account! For younger learners, there wil be Circle Time, books, and lesson plans. For older learners, they can get a head start in their future grade level skills. The apps can also be
        separately used as resources. Here is a link to the lesson plans:

    <h3 style="color: blue;">#2 Duolingo</h3>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">
        Learning a new language is a great way to keep engaged. This will also be a fun activity for the whole family. Duolingo is also free, and can be personalized to fit each family member. Learning a new language is very educational, and if one of the kids
        are going to middle school, it can be very helpful. Here is a link to the website:

    <h3 style="color: blue;">#3 Mimo</h3>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">
      Mimo is a great coding app for kids and adults alike. It starts with the
      basics of HTML, and then moves on to CSS, and then gradually JS. It is a
      great way to introduce coding to kids and it teaches them how to create
      websites. The best part is, all the lessons are free! For accessing more
      advanced projects though, you may have in-app purchases required. Here is
      the link to the website:

    <h3 style="color: blue;">#4 Educational Workbooks</h3>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">
        Well, what can I say? These workbooks are a boon to those who don't believe in digital learning. If looking for workbooks in the summer though, make sure to pick the grade the student is attending in the coming fall. I have enclosed some images of my
        favorite workbooks to use for Pre-K.

    <br />
    <h3 style="color: blue;">#5 Just Dance</h3>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">
        This is a great way to get some exercise and to have some fun! This is a fun activity for the whole family. You can buy the Just Dance game at a store or search "Just Dance" on Youtube. What are you waiting for, get dancing!

    <h3 style="color: blue;">#6 Story Time</h3>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">
        Daily story time is an essential activity. Make it a habit to read at least one book to your kids ,or, let them read books by themselves at a designated time of the day. Stories spark kids imaginations and provides a surefire way of entertainment.
